# Include details

{% hint style="info" %}
The quality of answers from large language models (LLMs) largely depends on how you ask your questions. Clear and detailed questions result in better and more specific answers. If the questions are vague, the model might not understand your exact needs.
{% endhint %}

### Clearly State Your Goal

Begin by clearly stating your purpose. Whether you're looking for information, guidance, or a solution, make sure your goal is explicitly expressed.

{% hint style="success" %}
Example 1: To get a book recommendation, be specific about the genre. Instead of just saying ~~"suggest a book"~~, say "I want a science fiction book recommendation".
{% endhint %}

### Include Necessary Background Information

It's important to provide context by including relevant background information.

{% hint style="success" %}
Example 2: When seeking travel advice, mention your preferences. For instance, say "I'm looking for a family-friendly beach destination in Europe for a summer holiday, with a moderate budget".
{% endhint %}

To ensure more precise answers, avoid asking vague or open-ended questions and instead ask specific, directed questions.

{% hint style="success" %}
Example 3: Instead of a general query like ~~"How do I fix my phone?"~~, provide specifics: "How can I fix a cracked screen on an iPhone 15?".
{% endhint %}
