# Include details

{% hint style="info" %}
The relevance and accuracy of LLM's responses greatly depend on how you frame your questions. Detailed and well-structured questions lead to more tailored and useful answers. Otherwise, you're essentially relying on the model to interpret or guess your intentions.
{% endhint %}

### **Define Objective Clearly**

It's crucial to start by stating your goal. If you're seeking information, advice, or a solution, ensure that your objective is unmistakably clear.

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Example 1:**_ If you're looking for a book recommendation, specify the genre. Say, "I want a science fiction book recommendation" instead of just ~~"suggest a book"~~.
{% endhint %}

***

### **Provide Relevant Context**

Always provide context by sharing relevant background information and include specific details such as numbers, dates, names, or features.

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Example 2**_**:** Instead of asking ~~"What's the weather like?"~~, ask "What's the weather forecast for New York City on January 5th?".
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Example 3**_**:** If asking for travel advice, include preferences: "I'm looking for a family-friendly beach destination in Europe for a summer holiday, with a moderate budget".
{% endhint %}

***

### **Avoid Ambiguity**

To improve the accuracy of the response, use descriptive keywords and avoid vague terms or open-ended questions. Strive for specificity to direct the model's response more effectively.

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Example 4**_**:** Rather than asking ~~"How do I fix my phone?"~~, specify the issue: "How can I fix a cracked screen on an iPhone 15?".
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
_**Example 5**_**:** For a recipe query, instead of saying ~~"pasta recipe"~~, specify "easy vegan pasta recipe under 30 minutes".
{% endhint %}
