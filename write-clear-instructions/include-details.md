# Include details

{% hint style="info" %}
The quality of answers from large language models (LLMs) largely depends on how you ask your questions. If the questions are vague, the model might not understand your exact needs.
{% endhint %}

***

### Clearly State Your Goal

Begin by clearly stating your goal. Whether you're looking for information, guidance, or a solution, make sure your goal is explicitly expressed.

{% hint style="success" %}
Example: Instead of a general question like ~~"How do I fix my phone?"~~, provide specific question: "How can I fix a cracked screen on an iPhone 15?".
{% endhint %}

### Include Necessary Background Information

It's important to provide context by including relevant background information such as names, numbers, dates, constraints,... to ensure you receive the most accurate and tailored response.

{% hint style="success" %}
Example: Instead of saying "I need travel suggestions," provide context by saying "I'm looking for a family-friendly beach destination in Europe for a summer holiday, with a moderate budget. Can you recommend some places?"
{% endhint %}
